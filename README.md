# learnedFastPAT
A Fourier domain reconstruction approach for planar photoacoustic tomography (PAT) measurements augmented with learned components.


A model-correction term in k -space is utilised to compensate for wrong speed of sound  that can be trained jointly with a
post-processing network to improve image quality and compensate for limited-view artefacts.
